## R Markdown

R Markdown provides a framework for combining  code, results and commentary.

You can use R Markdown 

- to generate high quality reports that can be shared with an audience.
- as an environment in which to do data science, as a lab notebook where 
  you can capture not only what you did, but also what you were thinking.

## How it works 

An R Markdown document is a basic text file, with the conventional extension `.Rmd`

The example already contains the most important components:

- An (optional) YAML header surrounded by ---.
- Chunks of R code surrounded by ```.
- Text mixed with simple text formatting like # heading and _italics_.

When we click **knit** then 
1. the `knitr` package executes the code chunks and creates a markdown (`.md`) document which contains the code and its output 
2. the `.md` file gets processed by `pandoc` which creates the final file in the desired output format (eg. `html`, `pdf`, `word`, ...)

## The YAML header

The YAML header contains the meta data of the document.
Here you can specify: 
- the output format with optional output specific options 

```{}
---
output: html_document
---
```
