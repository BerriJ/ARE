## Why should we use Databases?

- The amount of data you can work with in R is constraint by your memory. 
- In times where data sets with several 100 GB or even TB are become more and more common
  loading all data into memory is often not feasable. 
- Often only a subset or an aggregation of the data is required for the analysis which requires much less memory space.
- How to subset or aggregate data? &rarr; Use a database!



```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
con <- DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), dbname  = here::here("databases", "mtcars.sqlite3"))
DBI::dbWriteTable(con, "mtcars", mtcars)
copy_to(con, mtcars, "mtcars")

tbl(con, "mtcars")
DBI::dbDisconnect(con)

con <- DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), path = here::here("databases", "mtcars.sqlite3"))


```
