# What is a Version Control System (VCS)?

# What is a VCS?

- Like a database that tracks changes of your work
- Lets you take a snapshot of your project at any time
- Independend of the technology / framework that you are working with
- Works with many file formats like Latex, R, HTML and many more.

---

# The benefits of using a VCS?

###Collaboration
Working together in a shared folder like Goole Drive / Dropbox brings conflicts very quickly.

--

### Storing Versions (Properly)
Without a VCS you would have to save the whole project every time you decide to 'save the current state'.

--

### Restoring Previous Versions
The VCS is your safety net. Every time you mess up by doing something crazy (again!) you can go back and restore the previous state.

---
# The benefits of using a VCS?

### Understanding what happened

Everytime you commit a new Version to your repository you provide a short description. 

If it's code or a text file git can additionally show you what exactly has been changed.

--

### Backup

A very nice side effect of using a distributed VCS is that it can act as a backup.

Every team member has the full version of the project (including the complete history) on its Disc.

# What is git?

![](images/git_logo_2.svg)

"Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency."

# Benefits of using Git

--

### Popularity

Git is (by far!) the most widely used modern version control system in the world

Used by Google, Netflix, Facebook and the Chair of Econometrics at Uni-Due

--

### Security

Git has been designed with the integrity of managed source code as a top priority.
--

### It is free and open source

# What is Github?

- Github hosts your git repositories online
- Having a so called 'remote repository' let's you
    + share your work with others
    + continiue your work on a different machine

# Why Github?

- Over 100 Million repositories are hosted on github
- Github belongs to Microsoft
    + Witht the support of Microsoft github under active developement
- Github is very popular
    + There are Github integrations in R-Studio, Atom, Sublime etc.
- Github has additional features that improve your workflow
    + Bug tracking
    + Managing of permissions of the repositories

# Let's get started!

![](images/start.png)

---
# First Steps

### 1. Download and Install Git 

<a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads"><img src="images/git_logo.png" style="width:100px" title="Git" alt="Git"></a>

--

### 2. Make an Account at Github

<a href="https://github.com/join?source=header-home"><img src="images/GitHub-Logo.png" style="width:100px" title="Github" alt="Github"></a>

--

### 3. Download and Install Github-Desktop (optional)

<a href="https://desktop.github.com/"><img src="images/desktop-icon.svg" style="width:100" title="Github" alt="Github"></a>

---
# Verify your Installation:

- Git is a command line tool. That is, most of the time we will work with the command line.
- However, there is software like Github-Desktop that provides a GUI for managing your repositories.

### Start your Terminal /CMD

- Windows: Press "Win-R," type "cmd" and press "Enter"
- Mac: Open the "Terminal" Application
- Linux: you already know ;)

---

# Verify your Installation:

By typing 'git --version' git will return the installed version to you. If everything went smoothly it should look like this:

```terminal
Jonathan@MacBookPro: ~ jonathan $ git --version
git version 2.22.0
```
---

class: center, middle

# git init

![](images/git_init.svg)

---

# Create your first repository

You probably want to create a new folder for your first repository and navigate into it. However, it is perfectly fine to init a repository in an existing folder.

We create a folder called 'git', inside 'git' we create 'firstrepo' and initialize it with 'git init'.

```terminal
Jonathan@MacBookPro: ~ $ mkdir git
Jonathan@MacBookPro: ~ $ cd git
Jonathan@MacBookPro: ~/git $ mkdir firstrepo
Jonathan@MacBookPro: ~/git $ cd firstrepo
Jonathan@MacBookPro: ~/git/firstrepo $ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in 
/Users/jonathan/git/firstrepo/.git/
```
---

# Configure Git

Sometimes git asks you to provide some information (for example a commit message) and opens an editor for that. The standard is VIM. VIM can be complicated for new users. Hence we want to change the default Editor to NANO.

```terminal
Jonathan@MacBookPro: ~ $ git config --global core.editor "nano -w"

```
---

# Create a change

We have to be creative here. Maybe the students could write a function in R that is helpful later on?

---

class: center, middle

# git status

![](images/git_status.svg)

---

# git status

git status gives you an overview of your repository.

```terminal
Jonathan@MacBookPro: ~/git/firstrepo $ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	super_important_function.r

nothing added to commit but untracked files present 
(use "git add" to track)
```

Git tells us that there is one untracked file and proposes to add this file to our repository.

---

# The basic git workflow

Developing a project usually follows the basic edit/stage/commit pattern. First, you edit your files in the working directory. When you’re ready to save a copy of the current state of the project, you stage changes with 'git add'. After you’re happy with the staged snapshot, you commit it to the project history with 'git commit'. The 'git reset' command is used to undo a commit or staged snapshot.

---

# git add

Let's stage our changes with 'git add'. We can stage all changes that are present in our working directory by executing 'git add .' Otherwise we have to specifiy the specific file instead of using a dot.

```terminal
Jonathan@MacBookPro: ~/git/firstrepo $ git add .
Jonathan@MacBookPro: ~/git/firstrepo $ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

	new file:   super_important_function.r
```

---

class: center, middle

# git commit

![](images/commit.svg)

---

# git commit

Now we want to commit our changes to our repository. We can do this by typing 'git commit'. Afterward, git asks you to provide a commit message. The commit message is mandatory. Git will open an Editor for that and waits untill you saved closed the file. You can avoid this behaviour by providing the commit message directly as follows:

```terminal
Jonathan@MacBookPro: ~/git/firstrepo $ git commit -m "Init commit"
[master (root-commit) 2beba8d] Init commit
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 super_important_function.r
```
---

# git commit --amend

Has to be decided if we want to add a slide for that.

---
# Writing bad Commit Messages

![](images/commit_messages.png)

---

# The Seven Rules of a Great Git Commit Message

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

Every commit is only as useful as it's[commit messages](http://whatthecommit.com/). Thus it makes sense investing some time in learning [how to write good commit messages](http://example.com). You'll be treated later when things went horribly wrong and you are desperately trying to recover the last working state of your project.

---

# git log

The git log command displays committed snapshots. It lets you list the project history, filter it, and search for specific changes. Use 'git log --oneline" for a more compact output.

```terminal
Jonathan@MacBookPro: ~/git/firstrepo $ git log

# Undoing Commits & Changes

![](images/revert.svg)

---

# git checkout

The whole idea behind any version control system is to store “safe” copies of a project so that you never have to worry about irreparably breaking your code base.

When you have found a commit reference to the point in history you want to visit, you can utilize the 'git checkout' command to visit that commit. 

```terminal
Jonathan@MacBookPro: ~/git/firstrepo $ git checkout 2beba8d
Note: checking out '2beba8d3fc65cb18f60532c18d9f299bf5590f50'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

HEAD is now at 2beba8d Init commit
```
---
# The Detached Head State

On the prevoius slide git told you about a 'detached head state' and it's consequences.

During the normal course of development, the HEAD usually points to master or some other local branch, but when you check out a previous commit, HEAD no longer points to a branch—it points directly to a commit. This is called a “detached HEAD” state, and it can be visualized as the following:

![](images/detached_head.svg)
---

# git revert

![Revert](images/git_revert.svg)

<br>

The git revert command can be considered an 'undo' type command, however, it is not a traditional undo operation. Instead of removing the commit from the project history, it figures out how to invert the changes introduced by the commit and appends a new commit with the resulting inverse content.

It's important to understand that git revert undoes a single commit it does not "revert" back to the previous state of a project by removing all subsequent commits. In Git, this is actually called a reset, not a revert.

# Collbaboration

- This is where github.com comes into play
- You can link your offline repository to a central repository on github.com
- Pull new commits from the 'remote' into your local repository
- Push new commits from your local repository into the 'remote'

Let's create a remote repository for our 'firstrepo':

1. Go to [https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
2. Name your remote repository
3. Decide wether it should be private or public
4. Click 'Create Repository'
5. Copy the repository link:
