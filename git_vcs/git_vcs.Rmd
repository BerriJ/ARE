# What is a VCS?

- Like a database that tracks changes of your work
- Lets you take a snapshot of your project at any time
- Independend of the technology / framework that you are working with
- Works with many file formats like Latex, R, HTML and many more.

---

# The benefits of using a VCS?

###Collaboration
Working together in a shared folder like Goole Drive / Dropbox brings conflicts very quickly.

--

### Storing Versions (Properly)
Without a VCS you would have to save the whole project every time you decide to 'save the current state'.

--

### Restoring Previous Versions
The VCS is your safety net. Every time you mess up by doing something crazy (again!) you can go back and restore the previous state.

---
# The benefits of using a VCS?

### Understanding what happened

Everytime you commit a new Version to your repository you provide a short description. 

If it's code or a text file git can additionally show you what exactly has been changed.

--

### Backup

A very nice side effect of using a distributed VCS is that it can act as a backup.

Every team member has the full version of the project (including the complete history) on its Disc.

- However, there is software like Github-Desktop that provides a GUI for managing your repositories.

### Start your Terminal /CMD

- Windows: Press "Win-R," type "cmd" and press "Enter"
- Mac: Open the "Terminal" Application
- Linux: you already know ;)
